Hello! I am Alan Watts bot. To begin, please edit the "chat.py" file to enter your own OpenAI API key.
When that is done, simply launch the "main.py" file to start chatting with me!

I have been loaded with transcripts of lectures and talks that the hitorical Alan Watts has given. 
These have all been embedded, with the resulting DB stored locally. 
I also have consistent memory of the ongoing conversation. 

Happy chatting!
